# STATUS

## Confirmed working

- Menu-bar panel tracks live Claude Code sessions via `~/.claude/spinnerfeed/`
  feed files (hooks + statusLine in `~/.claude/settings.json`).
- First-run one-click installer (Install hooks button) writes the scripts and
  back-up-then-merges the hooks/statusLine into settings.json.
- CI: 37 unit tests green; runs on a self-hosted runner (project is Xcode 27
  format 110, which GitHub-hosted runners can't open).
- Panel rows carry the session's own name (`session_name` from status.json,
  falling back to the directory), its context token count banded on absolute
  usage (100k/150k/200k), and sort heaviest-first within each status band.
  The header totals context across all sessions. Legible in both appearances.

## Known broken

(none)

## Scope / by-design limitations

- **Captures Claude Code sessions only** — CLI (terminal/VS Code/Ghostty/iTerm)
  and the Claude **Desktop app's Code tab** (same engine, fires the same
  settings.json hooks). It does NOT capture the Desktop app's **Chat tab** or
  claude.ai web chat: those run no lifecycle hooks and no statusLine, and there
  is no supported API for their live turn state. Wiring to Desktop internals
  (`~/Library/Logs/Claude/main.log`, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`,
  or accessibility scraping) was considered and rejected as brittle. To see a
  desktop session in the spinner, use the Code tab.

## Next Up

- Notarization (needs an Apple Developer cert).

### 2026-07-17
- Decided: the row names the session, not the project — `session_name` is the
  only thing separating two sessions in one directory. The cwd moved to the
  tooltip.
- Decided: context tints band on absolute tokens, not percent — a 1m window
  makes 200k read as a harmless 20%.
- Decided: rows sort by context weight *within* a status band, not globally, so
  a heavy idle session can't outrank one waiting on you.
- Decided: dark-mode colors live in code, not an asset catalog — run.sh's
  swiftc fallback compiles only the three sources and would drop a colorset.

### 2026-07-10
- Decided: keep the spinner scoped to Claude Code sessions; do not observe the
  Desktop Chat tab via unsupported internals. Documented the Code-tab (hooks
  fire) vs Chat-tab (no hooks) distinction.
